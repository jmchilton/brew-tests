Platform Brew
=============

Platform Brew is an experimental extension to Homebrew implemented as
[external
commands](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands)
aimed at enabling greater reproducibility and usage from within
platforms.

To install platform-brew once you have installed Homebrew or linuxbrew
- simply execute `brew tap jmchilton/platform` and then `brew install
--HEAD platform-brew`.
