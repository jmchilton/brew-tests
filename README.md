Platform Brew
=============

Platform Brew is an experimental extension to Homebrew implemented as
Homebrew [external
commands](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands)
aimed at enabling greater reproducibility, allowing usage multiple
versions of software, and use from within platforms.

To install platform-brew once you have installed Homebrew or linuxbrew
- simply execute `brew tap platform-brew/tap` and then `brew install
platform-brew`.

For more information on the goals of the project - checkout [this
